## About The Project

In this challenge I will be building a responsive URL Shortening API landing page called shortly.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. Shorten any valid URL
3. See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
4. Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
5. Receive an error message when the form is submitted if: The input field is empty

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Browser Local Storage
- shrtcode api
- Asynchronous Javascript
- Navigator Web API

## What I Learned

I learned how to make data persist in between page loads with local storage. How to write more reusable javascript functions. I also learned how to use the Javascript navigator object to copy text with a button click. This was also the first project I used the Intersection Observer to make a sticky navigation bar. The big one is I learned I need to test in Safari a lot more. I ran into a lot of problems when I finished the challenge and opened it up on the safari browser.

## Useful Resources

Figma - Paste the design image inside of figma to check containers, width, etc...
